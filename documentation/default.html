  <h1>TinySoar</h1>

  <h3>About</h3>

  <p>
   <em>TinySoar</em> is an implementation of the

   <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/soar">Soar</a>

   artificial intelligence architecture that is intended to run on a
   memory-constrained device, like a robot.  Soar is a &ldquo;real
   time&rdquo; (as opposed to &ldquo;off-line&rdquo;) performance
   runtime that incorporates acting, planning, and learning in a
   rule-based framework.
  </p>

  <p>
   TinySoar consists of two primary components. The first is a
   portable, light-weight <em>runtime</em> that implements the Soar
   decision cycle as a host for a Soar agent. The second is a <em>Tcl
   extension</em> that is used to create and debug Soar agents, and
   then export them into a format that can be compiled into the
   runtime component.
  </p>

  <p>
   A sample embedding (in fact, the one that inspired the project!) is
   also included: alternative firmware for the

   <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/">Lego&reg; Mindstorms RCX</a>

   that embeds the TinySoar runtime. Using this firmware, you can
   control a Lego robot with a Soar agent.

    The latest source tarball. The <code>tinysoar-0.3.2</code> runtime
    supports the basic Soar decision cycle. Impasses are also
    supported, although chunking is not yet implemented. Included is
    the Tcl extension for developing and debugging agents, firmware
    for the Lego Mindstorms RCX, minimal documentation, and sample
    agent code.
