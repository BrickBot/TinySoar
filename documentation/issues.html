  <h1>Differences Between TinySoar and Soar8</h1>

  <p>
   TinySoar, in order to be tiny, does not implement many of the
   features available in Soar8. This document lists some of the
   differences between TinySoar and Soar8, as well as some of the
   known issues (ahem, bugs) in TinySoar.
  </p>

  <h3>No support for chunking, justifications, or impasses</h3>

  <p>
   TinySoar currently doesn't implement chunking or justifications,
   and thus has no way to resolve impasses. This is currently being
   implemented on the trunk, but is highly experimental at this point.
  </p>

  <h3>Conjunctive negative conditions are not supported</h3>

  <p>
   In Soar8, you can write a rule with <em>conjunctive negative
   conditions</em>; i.e., a negative test that is the conjunction of
   several tests. For example:
  </p>

  <pre class="code">sp {check*no*operator*foo
    (state &lt;s&gt; ^superstate nil)
  -{(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;)
    (&lt;o&gt; ^name foo)}
    --&gt;
    <i>/* do something */</i>}</pre>

  <p>
   This production will match when there is no <code>^operator</code>
   with a <code>^name</code> of <code>foo</code> on the state. Here's
   another example:
  </p>

  <pre class="code">sp {check*no*foo*and*bar
    (state &lt;s&gt; ^superstate nil)
   -(&lt;s&gt; ^foo t ^bar t)
    --&gt;
    <i>/* do something */</i>}</pre>

  <p>
   This production will match when <code>^foo&nbsp;t</code> and
   <code>^bar&nbsp;t</code> are both not present on the state at the
   same time.
  </p>

  <p>
   Most of the time, it should be possible to implement equivalent
   functionality by breaking a rule with conjunctive negative
   conditions into two rules: one that detects the negative condition
   and annotates the state, and another that detects the state
   annotation and triggers the original intended operation. For
   example, <code>check*no*foo*and*bar</code> could re-written in two
   rules without a conjunctive negative condition as follows:
  </p>

  <pre class="code">sp {check*foo*and*bar
    (state &lt;s&gt; ^superstate nil ^foo t ^bar t)
    --&gt;
    (&lt;s&gt; ^foo-and-bar t)}

sp {check*no*foo-and-bar
    (state &lt;s&gt; ^superstate nil -^foo-band-bar t)
    --&gt;
    <i>/* do something */</i>}</pre>

  <p>
   Unfortunately, there are some issues with this approach. For
   example, to break <code>check*no*operator*foo</code> into two
   productions, we'd end up with a <code>^operator-foo&nbsp;t</code>
   annotation on the state that is <em>o-supported</em> because it's
   tested the operator.
  </p>

  <p>
   So, it's not clear at this time whether implementing conjunctive
   negative conditions in TinySoar would be a good thing to do or
   not. It certainly is a wonderful convenience for authoring rules,
   and may even be a necessity to achieve some sorts of behavior.
   However, that convenience comes at the price of additional runtime
   code, which is at a premium.
  </p>

  <h3>Expressions are not supported in a rule's RHS</h3>

  <p>
   In Soar8, you can write a rule like this:
  </p>

  <pre class="code">sp {increment*foo
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^foo &lt;i&gt;)
   --&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^foo &lt;i&gt; - ^foo (+ &lt;i&gt; 1) +)}</pre>

  <p>
   In other words, replace the integer value <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>
   with <code>&lt;i&gt;&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</code>. This is not currently
   supported.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=508521&amp;group_id=42131&amp;atid=432196">The runtime can run out of identifiers</a></h3>

  <p>
   Identifiers are not heap-allocated objects, like they are in
   Soar8: each new identifier is assigned a monotonically increasing
   integral value. Unfortunately, on a real computer, that means you
   can overflow the representation. For example, on the Lego
   Mindstorms RCX, there are 14 bits available to store the
   identifier's value, allowing for no more than 16,384
   identifiers. When an overflow occurs, behavior becomes undefined
   -- definitely a bug! (The current plan is to fix this by recycling
   the identifier values that aren't in use.)
